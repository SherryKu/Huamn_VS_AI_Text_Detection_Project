Here's my essay about my grandfather and why I want to visit Florida:  My grandfather was the coolest person I know. He was always the first one on the soccer field, ready to play and have fun. He taught me how to play when I was five years old, and I've been hooked ever since. He was the one who bought me my first soccer ball, and he cheered me on at every game. Even though he's not here anymore, he still has a huge impact on my love for soccer.  My grandfather was born in Florida, and he always talked about how beautiful it was there. He said the beaches were amazing, and the weather was perfect. He told me stories about how he used to go fishing with his friends and family, and how they would catch huge fish. I've always wanted to see Florida for myself, and I think it would be an awesome place to visit. I would love to go fishing with my grandfather's friends and family, and see the places he used to go.  I think visiting Florida would be a great way to honor my grandfather's memory. He was always talking about how much he loved Florida, and I know he would want me to see it for myself. Plus, it would be a fun adventure to go on with my family. We could spend time together, and make some new memories.  I know my grandfather is always with me in my heart, but I think visiting Florida would be a way to honor his memory and keep him close. He was an amazing person, and I'm lucky to have had him in my life. I'm sure he would want me to be happy and have fun, and visiting Florida would be a great way to do that.  So, Mrs. Johnson, I really want to visit Florida because of my grandfather. He taught me how to love soccer, and I want to honor his memory by visiting the place he loved so much. Plus, it would be a fun adventure with my family!\",\n          \"Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students with the exception of a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise their\\u00a0review\\u00a0based on feedback of former students  Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are useful\\u00a0because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, students\\u00a0will\\u00a0work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.  When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.  Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.  Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves in\\u00a0the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life.\\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x = data['text'].tolist()\n","y = data['generated'].astype(int).tolist()"],"metadata":{"id":"7By2tVzk8vjY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715131277922,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Tokenization Optimization"],"metadata":{"id":"H18nCR75Mn25"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## empirical testing to find the optimal max_len on Tokens"],"metadata":{"id":"EhnCahOnydoX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import DistilBertTokenizerFast\n","\n","texts = data['text'].tolist()\n","\n","# Initialize tokenizer\n","MODEL_NAME = 'distilbert-base-uncased'\n","tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)\n","\n","# Tokenize texts and calculate lengths\n","token_lengths = [len(tokenizer.encode(text, add_special_tokens=True)) for text in texts]\n","\n","# Create a DataFrame to analyze token lengths\n","lengths_df = pd.DataFrame(token_lengths, columns=['length'])\n","\n","# Descriptive statistics\n","print(lengths_df.describe())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":356,"referenced_widgets":["56a444195d1844e18627757006f988c5","0cada8d318004439894e17c479236d1d","2b7d5968ce5e4a439d598f95464803bd","18552c26ad4a4df28d8e098154dbd8ea","0ceb8b67a2d1459a8ade9bf61305e5b5","a51cca297fcc4041be113e6e145bebf0","fad34bdd7631488a984dea878898a65f","2fa9360f4e4f42ee8c5c2b700e480d72","3f0c5cfc6ed7454ea293f9010a67baa3","96ab25c63ccc4f5da31445e69082c565","3bda5873433240f58ac3902e1fb65794","d58fffc0401d49cda0d3e726bb94c82b","aacf880e78ef455fb6394a13f2e3f3ce","36ab1f6bca2147edb3748cd2297941ca","98551a3f060044cea9e05eb57d8f4384","6a6a78e319b9406c9dd7f6060bdd3ae8","7e63221c360d4a22a1f51e7d971e8265","020eea782e3e45caa87017eea6b5d8a6","c39e4e7166284a2fa2eb23a92a324724","88a4013e853b4920a4680b0e26c8c53e","1d658766d9464f44879b6bba72288564","08fb9fb0dc8f47cab46579aef941adde","6e18297e12b04bfda8a9bc2e734608d3","e5b67427d44243f1b387a0d480439f34","dcfbb3a7b96d4729acc2799c457e1054","837885872d54414698f7335b7c9794ff","77450f55c8fb4e1c8b00a6a83a2f0b85","df3b11652da542bcbca42f88e3b9ca45","ca7383c79182430b99e099578c8e22fe","874540df22e249b89c166db97e7d5087","0ee605f360df49f38dc90ca3911cdc20","547f7936cc074922904886ada68e4cfd","af909541115d4d8d9dbb35bebb91d4bf","ea46cb6a1d1347c79a6f87f7d0326074","7a4f8356375d4a4c83bcfc8ff3874f33","6e4f6de143ea43499f562ae61914434b","e63854d2e37d449094c79ec0c2d4d2b0","776b8f6d2f2946c89825e3dcf7e7766d","db6f33091364442e85d5d8aff2bebce9","69962f2ea8464b59b13ef35c638d5642","6e32d1f8ee6c4a8d836ac710c1411193","27fb84393f2b409daa5e21a78b1dded7","8d9088d0cc5943ecbfcfacaf745355df","3cc449e746ee40398373658e80f8378d"]},"id":"2dYAWK_Cx-yY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714946750985,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":150929,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"e2152750-0dc2-40d7-e6bf-fd989c245a24"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/file_download.py:1132: FutureWarning: `resume_download` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0.

Its proponents extol its virtues, emphasizing its ability to protect the interests of smaller states and prevent the tyranny of the majority. Opponents, on the other hand, denounce its flaws, arguing that it is undemocratic, disenfranchises millions of voters, and can lead to outcomes that are not reflective of the popular will. The question of whether the Electoral College works is a complex one, requiring careful examination of its history, functions, and consequences.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. It was designed as a compromise between those who wanted to elect the president by a popular vote and those who wanted to have Congress choose the president. The Electoral College system allocates a certain number of electoral votes to each state, based on its population. The number of electoral votes is equal to the number of senators and representatives in Congress, plus three. The candidate who wins the most electoral votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes, which is currently 270 out of a total of 538.\\n\\nProponents of the Electoral College argue that it is a necessary safeguard for the interests of smaller states. They point out that in a direct popular vote system, candidates would only campaign in large, populous states, ignoring the needs and concerns of rural and less populated areas. The Electoral College, they argue, ensures that all states have a say in the election and prevents any one state or region from dominating the process.\\n\\nAnother argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it prevents the tyranny of the majority. In a direct popular vote system, it is possible for a candidate to win the presidency with a bare majority of the vote, even if a large number of people oppose that candidate. The Electoral College, however, requires a candidate to win a majority of the electoral votes, which makes it more difficult for a candidate to win without broad support across the country.\\n\\nOpponents of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and disenfranchises millions of voters. They point out that the Electoral College system can result in a candidate winning the presidency even if they lose the popular vote. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidency even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.\\n\\nOpponents also argue that the Electoral College gives too much power to swing states, such as Florida and Ohio, which can often determine the outcome of an election. This means that candidates can focus their campaigns on a small number of states, ignoring the needs of voters in other states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College has been the subject of numerous reform proposals over the years. Some proposals would abolish the Electoral College altogether and replace it with a direct popular vote system. Others would make changes to the Electoral College system, such as allocating electoral votes proportionally based on the popular vote in each state.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a complex system with both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to understand the arguments for and against the Electoral College in order to form an informed opinion about its merits. Ultimately, the question of whether the Electoral College works is a matter of opinion, and there is no easy answer.,1,Does the electoral college work?,gemini_pro,True\",\n          \"In the vast expanse of the cosmos, the human gaze has been captivated by celestial wonders, seeking out signs of life beyond our earthly realm. Among these cosmic enigmas, the Face on Mars has ignited both fascination and debate, challenging our understanding of Mars and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence. In this essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars, an intriguing formation resembling a human face on the Red Planet, is a natural geological feature rather than evidence of an ancient Martian civilization.\\n\\nThe initial discovery of the Face on Mars dates back to 1976 when the Viking 1 orbiter captured images of the Cydonia region, revealing a peculiar mesa that appeared to resemble a human face. This striking formation, reminiscent of the Sphinx in Egypt, sparked widespread speculation and captured the public's imagination. However, as subsequent missions to Mars provided higher-resolution images and more detailed data, the consensus among scientists shifted toward a more terrestrial explanation for the Face's origins.\\n\\nOne of the strongest arguments against the artificial nature of the Face on Mars lies in its geological context. The Cydonia region is known for its complex geological history, characterized by erosion, tectonic activity, and the formation of various landforms. The mesa that appears to resemble a face is believed to be the result of natural geological processes, such as wind erosion and weathering. The intricate interplay of these processes over millions of years can produce remarkably lifelike formations without requiring any external intervention from intelligent beings.\\n\\nSupporting this geological explanation is the lack of evidence suggesting the presence of an ancient Martian civilization. Despite extensive exploration and analysis of the Martian surface, no conclusive signs of past or present life have been discovered. The absence of any accompanying artifacts, structures, or evidence of intelligent activity further weakens the argument for a man-made Face on Mars.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Face's perceived symmetry and resemblance to a human face can be attributed to pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to perceive meaningful patterns or faces in random or ambiguous stimuli. Our brains are wired to recognize faces, and this natural tendency can lead us to interpret ordinary objects or formations as resembling human features. This phenomenon is not unique to the Face on Mars and has been observed in other instances of perceived faces in clouds, rocks, and even everyday objects.\\n\\nWhile the Face on Mars has captured the human imagination and fueled speculation about extraterrestrial life, the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports a natural geological explanation for its formation. The absence of supporting evidence for an ancient Martian civilization, coupled with the geological context and the phenomenon of pareidolia, strongly suggests that the Face on Mars is a product of natural processes rather than an artifact of intelligent design.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars, once considered a tantalizing clue to extraterrestrial life, has been demystified by scientific investigation and geological understanding. The compelling illusion of a human face is likely the result of natural geological processes and pareidolia, highlighting the limitations of our perception and the vastness of the natural wonders that the universe holds.,1,The Face on Mars,gemini_pro,True\",\n          \"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, is an objective and comprehensive method for analyzing and describing facial expressions. This system has gained significant recognition and widespread applications across various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, computer vision, and animation. Despite its valuable contributions, FACS has been the subject of criticism and debate, primarily due to its complexity and potential limitations. This essay aims to explore the arguments for and against the use of FACS in the analysis of facial expressions.\\n\\nOne of the primary strengths of FACS lies in its objectivity and systematic approach. The system provides a standardized framework for describing facial movements based on the contraction and relaxation of specific facial muscles. This enables researchers and practitioners to communicate and compare facial expressions across different studies and contexts consistently. The objectivity of FACS also reduces the influence of subjective interpretations and biases that may arise when relying solely on verbal descriptions or subjective ratings of facial expressions.\\n\\nFACS has demonstrated its utility in various research applications. It has been successfully employed to investigate the relationship between facial expressions and emotions, including the identification and classification of basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. FACS has also been used to study the development of facial expressions in infants and children, as well as the impact of cultural and social factors on facial expression patterns. Furthermore, FACS has been applied in clinical settings to assess emotional disorders, such as depression and autism, where difficulties in recognizing and expressing emotions are common.\\n\\nHowever, FACS is not without its limitations and criticisms. One of the main concerns raised is its complexity and the extensive training required to become proficient in using the system. The FACS manual comprises over 500 action units, each representing a specific facial movement. This complexity can be daunting for researchers and practitioners who may not have the time or resources to undergo extensive training. Moreover, the coding process itself can be time-consuming, especially when analyzing lengthy video recordings or large datasets.\\n\\nAnother criticism of FACS is that it focuses primarily on the physical manifestation of facial expressions without considering the underlying emotional state or intention behind them. While FACS can accurately describe the facial movements, it does not provide direct insight into the subjective experiences or emotional processes associated with those expressions. This limitation has led to debates about the ecological validity of FACS, as it may not fully capture the richness and complexity of real-world facial expressions.\\n\\nFurthermore, FACS has been criticized for its cultural bias. The system was developed based on data collected primarily from Western cultures, raising concerns about its applicability and generalizability to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Cultural variations in facial expression patterns and the social norms surrounding emotional expression may limit the accuracy and validity of FACS when applied to non-Western populations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) remains a valuable tool for analyzing and describing facial expressions, particularly in research settings. Its objectivity, standardization, and wide range of applications have made it a dominant approach in the field. However, FACS is not without its limitations, including its complexity, focus on physical movements rather than emotional states, and potential cultural bias. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of these limitations and consider alternative methods or complementary approaches when appropriate. Future research and developments in the field of facial expression analysis may address these limitations and enhance the ecological validity and applicability of FACS to diverse populations and contexts.,1,Facial action coding system,gemini_pro,True\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gemini_test_df = pd.concat([filtered_datatweep, gemini], ignore_index=True)\n","gemini_test_df['text'] = clean(gemini_test_df['text'])"],"metadata":{"id":"fWw9VA1dfbz0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135213083,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":261,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gemini_test_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"id":"nULplh62iufI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135215816,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":410,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"64f60d8d-e5af-444d-8fc4-6189c3e03991"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text  generated\n","0     justin timberlake really one of the goats if y...          0\n","1     Thank you @PMBhutan for your gracious prayers ...          0\n","2     Theory: the number of red lights you will hit ...          0\n","3     Might give the BASIC #10Liner game contest ano...          0\n","4              I Wanna See Some Rainbows Out There Boys          0\n","...                                                 ...        ...\n","4773  The Electoral College, a distinctive feature o...          1\n","4774  The Electoral College is a system of indirect ...          1\n","4775  The electoral College, an integral part of the...          1\n","4776  The Electoral College, a distinctive feature o...          1\n","4777  Title: Does the Electoral College Work?

However, in the story \\\"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,\\\" author Steven Raichlen introduces us to a unique blend of the Western frontier and the vastness of the ocean, challenging our traditional notions of what it means to be a cowboy. Through the protagonist's remarkable journey, Raichlen invites us to embrace the untamed spirit that lies within us all, regardless of our background or circumstances.  The protagonist, a young cowboy named Jack, finds himself drawn to the allure of the sea. His curiosity and adventurous spirit lead him to leave behind the familiar landscapes of the Wild West and embark on a voyage across the open waters. As he navigates the unpredictable nature of the ocean, Jack encounters challenges that test his resilience and resourcefulness. Through his interactions with the sea and the people he meets along the way, he discovers a new sense of purpose and identity.  One of the key themes explored in the story is the idea of embracing the unknown. Jack's decision to venture into uncharted territory, both physically and figuratively, demonstrates his willingness to step outside of his comfort zone and challenge himself in new ways. His journey serves as a reminder that true growth and fulfillment often come from stepping into the unknown and embracing the uncertainty that lies ahead.  Another important aspect of the story is the connection between the cowboy and the sea. Traditionally associated with the land, the cowboy figure is often seen as a symbol of the American frontier. However, Raichlen's portrayal of Jack as a cowboy who rides the waves blurs the boundaries between the land and the sea, suggesting that the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of freedom can be found in any realm.  Through Jack's transformative journey, the story also highlights the importance of embracing one's unique identity. Jack's initial hesitation to share his cowboy heritage with the people he meets on his travels reflects his fear of being judged or misunderstood. However, as he gains confidence and learns to appreciate the value of his experiences, he comes to realize that his cowboy identity is an integral part of who he is.  In conclusion, \\\"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\\\" offers a powerful and inspiring message about embracing the untamed spirit within us. Through Jack's remarkable journey, Raichlen challenges traditional notions of what it means to be a cowboy and encourages us to embrace the unknown, forge our own paths, and celebrate our unique identities. The story serves as a reminder that true freedom and fulfillment come from living life on our own terms, regardless of the obstacles that may come our way.,1,\\\"\\\"\\\"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\\\"\\\"\\\",gemini_pro,True\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Apply encoding to dataset\n","encodings_2 = construct_encodings(gemini_test_df['text'].tolist(), tokenizer, MAX_LEN)\n","\n","tfdataset_2 = construct_tfdataset(encodings_2, gemini_test_df['generated'].tolist())\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wbIdeiYGfb1_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135240065,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1702,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}}},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["benchmarks_2 = model.evaluate(tfdataset_2.batch(BATCH_SIZE))\n","print(benchmarks_2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4Qj60FgCife0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135257056,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":14679,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"a1a20975-ee22-4ce3-fc68-97f198ffadcb"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["150/150 [==============================] - 15s 97ms/step - loss: 0.0863 - accuracy: 0.9797\n","[0.08632616698741913, 0.9796985983848572]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### test on US ai-patents dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"KdgoWtcMlwZX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!git clone https://github.com/MIRICMILAN/US-AI-Patents.git"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"esYBegMY2xE7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135269481,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1241,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"a1864d38-e7aa-4a47-af63-6f6c522aec97"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Cloning into 'US-AI-Patents'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 97, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 97 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 92\u001b[K\n","Receiving objects: 100% (97/97), 1.87 MiB | 28.95 MiB/s, done.\n","Resolving deltas: 100% (45/45), done.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","path = \"/content/US-AI-Patents/Training Data/4K Patents - AI 20p.csv\"\n","df = pd.read_csv(path)\n","df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":614},"id":"KCpr4MvBTUX6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715135270456,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":423,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"6678a87d-03db-48f1-fec2-56a44a67173d"},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["      Unnamed: 0    app number  actual  \\\n","0              0   US7070215B2       0   \n","1              1   US9018239B2       0   \n","2              2    US5257045A       0   \n","3              3   US6507704B2       0   \n","4              4   US9256249B2       0   \n","...          ...           ...     ...   \n","3995        3995    US4580513A       1   \n","3996        3996   US9066615B2       1   \n","3997        3997   US8995619B2       1   \n","3998        3998   US9519805B2       0   \n","3999        3999  US10035263B2       1   \n","\n","                                               abstract           ipc c  \\\n","0     Tilt latch mechanism for hung windows a dual f...

The question of whether the Electoral College works is a complex one, requiring careful examination of its history, functions, and consequences.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. It was designed as a compromise between those who wanted to elect the president by a popular vote and those who wanted to have Congress choose the president. The Electoral College system allocates a certain number of electoral votes to each state, based on its population. The number of electoral votes is equal to the number of senators and representatives in Congress, plus three. The candidate who wins the most electoral votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes. To win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes, which is currently 270 out of a total of 538.\\n\\nProponents of the Electoral College argue that it is a necessary safeguard for the interests of smaller states. They point out that in a direct popular vote system, candidates would only campaign in large, populous states, ignoring the needs and concerns of rural and less populated areas. The Electoral College, they argue, ensures that all states have a say in the election and prevents any one state or region from dominating the process.\\n\\nAnother argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it prevents the tyranny of the majority. In a direct popular vote system, it is possible for a candidate to win the presidency with a bare majority of the vote, even if a large number of people oppose that candidate. The Electoral College, however, requires a candidate to win a majority of the electoral votes, which makes it more difficult for a candidate to win without broad support across the country.\\n\\nOpponents of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and disenfranchises millions of voters. They point out that the Electoral College system can result in a candidate winning the presidency even if they lose the popular vote. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidency even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.\\n\\nOpponents also argue that the Electoral College gives too much power to swing states, such as Florida and Ohio, which can often determine the outcome of an election. This means that candidates can focus their campaigns on a small number of states, ignoring the needs of voters in other states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College has been the subject of numerous reform proposals over the years. Some proposals would abolish the Electoral College altogether and replace it with a direct popular vote system. Others would make changes to the Electoral College system, such as allocating electoral votes proportionally based on the popular vote in each state.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a complex system with both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to understand the arguments for and against the Electoral College in order to form an informed opinion about its merits. Ultimately, the question of whether the Electoral College works is a matter of opinion, and there is no easy answer.,1,Does the electoral college work?,gemini_pro,True\",\n          \"In the vast expanse of the cosmos, the human gaze has been captivated by celestial wonders, seeking out signs of life beyond our earthly realm. Among these cosmic enigmas, the Face on Mars has ignited both fascination and debate, challenging our understanding of Mars and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence. In this essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars, an intriguing formation resembling a human face on the Red Planet, is a natural geological feature rather than evidence of an ancient Martian civilization.\\n\\nThe initial discovery of the Face on Mars dates back to 1976 when the Viking 1 orbiter captured images of the Cydonia region, revealing a peculiar mesa that appeared to resemble a human face. This striking formation, reminiscent of the Sphinx in Egypt, sparked widespread speculation and captured the public's imagination. However, as subsequent missions to Mars provided higher-resolution images and more detailed data, the consensus among scientists shifted toward a more terrestrial explanation for the Face's origins.\\n\\nOne of the strongest arguments against the artificial nature of the Face on Mars lies in its geological context. The Cydonia region is known for its complex geological history, characterized by erosion, tectonic activity, and the formation of various landforms. The mesa that appears to resemble a face is believed to be the result of natural geological processes, such as wind erosion and weathering. The intricate interplay of these processes over millions of years can produce remarkably lifelike formations without requiring any external intervention from intelligent beings.\\n\\nSupporting this geological explanation is the lack of evidence suggesting the presence of an ancient Martian civilization. Despite extensive exploration and analysis of the Martian surface, no conclusive signs of past or present life have been discovered. The absence of any accompanying artifacts, structures, or evidence of intelligent activity further weakens the argument for a man-made Face on Mars.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Face's perceived symmetry and resemblance to a human face can be attributed to pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to perceive meaningful patterns or faces in random or ambiguous stimuli. Our brains are wired to recognize faces, and this natural tendency can lead us to interpret ordinary objects or formations as resembling human features. This phenomenon is not unique to the Face on Mars and has been observed in other instances of perceived faces in clouds, rocks, and even everyday objects.\\n\\nWhile the Face on Mars has captured the human imagination and fueled speculation about extraterrestrial life, the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports a natural geological explanation for its formation. The absence of supporting evidence for an ancient Martian civilization, coupled with the geological context and the phenomenon of pareidolia, strongly suggests that the Face on Mars is a product of natural processes rather than an artifact of intelligent design.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars, once considered a tantalizing clue to extraterrestrial life, has been demystified by scientific investigation and geological understanding. The compelling illusion of a human face is likely the result of natural geological processes and pareidolia, highlighting the limitations of our perception and the vastness of the natural wonders that the universe holds.,1,The Face on Mars,gemini_pro,True\",\n          \"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, is an objective and comprehensive method for analyzing and describing facial expressions. This system has gained significant recognition and widespread applications across various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, computer vision, and animation. Despite its valuable contributions, FACS has been the subject of criticism and debate, primarily due to its complexity and potential limitations. This essay aims to explore the arguments for and against the use of FACS in the analysis of facial expressions.\\n\\nOne of the primary strengths of FACS lies in its objectivity and systematic approach. The system provides a standardized framework for describing facial movements based on the contraction and relaxation of specific facial muscles. This enables researchers and practitioners to communicate and compare facial expressions across different studies and contexts consistently. The objectivity of FACS also reduces the influence of subjective interpretations and biases that may arise when relying solely on verbal descriptions or subjective ratings of facial expressions.\\n\\nFACS has demonstrated its utility in various research applications. It has been successfully employed to investigate the relationship between facial expressions and emotions, including the identification and classification of basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. FACS has also been used to study the development of facial expressions in infants and children, as well as the impact of cultural and social factors on facial expression patterns. Furthermore, FACS has been applied in clinical settings to assess emotional disorders, such as depression and autism, where difficulties in recognizing and expressing emotions are common.\\n\\nHowever, FACS is not without its limitations and criticisms. One of the main concerns raised is its complexity and the extensive training required to become proficient in using the system. The FACS manual comprises over 500 action units, each representing a specific facial movement. This complexity can be daunting for researchers and practitioners who may not have the time or resources to undergo extensive training. Moreover, the coding process itself can be time-consuming, especially when analyzing lengthy video recordings or large datasets.\\n\\nAnother criticism of FACS is that it focuses primarily on the physical manifestation of facial expressions without considering the underlying emotional state or intention behind them. While FACS can accurately describe the facial movements, it does not provide direct insight into the subjective experiences or emotional processes associated with those expressions. This limitation has led to debates about the ecological validity of FACS, as it may not fully capture the richness and complexity of real-world facial expressions.\\n\\nFurthermore, FACS has been criticized for its cultural bias. The system was developed based on data collected primarily from Western cultures, raising concerns about its applicability and generalizability to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. Cultural variations in facial expression patterns and the social norms surrounding emotional expression may limit the accuracy and validity of FACS when applied to non-Western populations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) remains a valuable tool for analyzing and describing facial expressions, particularly in research settings. Its objectivity, standardization, and wide range of applications have made it a dominant approach in the field. However, FACS is not without its limitations, including its complexity, focus on physical movements rather than emotional states, and potential cultural bias. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of these limitations and consider alternative methods or complementary approaches when appropriate. Future research and developments in the field of facial expression analysis may address these limitations and enhance the ecological validity and applicability of FACS to diverse populations and contexts.,1,Facial action coding system,gemini_pro,True\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gemini_test_df = pd.concat([filtered_datatweep, gemini], ignore_index=True)\n","gemini_test_df['text'] = clean(gemini_test_df['text'])"],"metadata":{"id":"EQPwA848p3Ta"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gemini_test_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715107230678,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Sherry Liu","userId":"11070116391552011914"}},"outputId":"0e8c1211-d5be-407c-c2dc-2bdc04ba5d7b","id":"eINf0zh6p3Ta"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   text  generated\n","0     justin timberlake really one of the goats if y...          0\n","1     thank you @pmbhutan for your gracious prayers ...          0\n","2     theory: the number of red lights you will hit ...          0\n","3     might give the basic #10liner game contest ano...          0\n","4              i wanna see some rainbows out there boys          0\n","...                                                 ...        ...\n","4773  the electoral college, a distinctive feature o...          1\n","4774  the electoral college is a system of indirect ...          1\n","4775  the electoral college, an integral part of the...          1\n","4776  the electoral college, a distinctive feature o...          1\n","4777  title: does the electoral college work?

the waves  in the annals of american history, the image of the cowboy evokes a sense of rugged individualism, boundless freedom, and a deep connection with the untamed wilderness. however, in the story \\\"a cowboy who rode the waves,\\\" author steven raichlen introduces us to a unique blend of the western frontier and the vastness of the ocean, challenging our traditional notions of what it means to be a cowboy. through the protagonist's remarkable journey, raichlen invites us to embrace the untamed spirit that lies within us all, regardless of our background or circumstances.  the protagonist, a young cowboy named jack, finds himself drawn to the allure of the sea. his curiosity and adventurous spirit lead him to leave behind the familiar landscapes of the wild west and embark on a voyage across the open waters. as he navigates the unpredictable nature of the ocean, jack encounters challenges that test his resilience and resourcefulness. through his interactions with the sea and the people he meets along the way, he discovers a new sense of purpose and identity.  one of the key themes explored in the story is the idea of embracing the unknown. jack's decision to venture into uncharted territory, both physically and figuratively, demonstrates his willingness to step outside of his comfort zone and challenge himself in new ways. his journey serves as a reminder that true growth and fulfillment often come from stepping into the unknown and embracing the uncertainty that lies ahead.  another important aspect of the story is the connection between the cowboy and the sea. traditionally associated with the land, the cowboy figure is often seen as a symbol of the american frontier. however, raichlen's portrayal of jack as a cowboy who rides the waves blurs the boundaries between the land and the sea, suggesting that the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of freedom can be found in any realm.  through jack's transformative journey, the story also highlights the importance of embracing one's unique identity. jack's initial hesitation to share his cowboy heritage with the people he meets on his travels reflects his fear of being judged or misunderstood. however, as he gains confidence and learns to appreciate the value of his experiences, he comes to realize that his cowboy identity is an integral part of who he is.  in conclusion, \\\"a cowboy who rode the waves\\\" offers a powerful and inspiring message about embracing the untamed spirit within us. through jack's remarkable journey, raichlen challenges traditional notions of what it means to be a cowboy and encourages us to embrace the unknown, forge our own paths, and celebrate our unique identities. the story serves as a reminder that true freedom and fulfillment come from living life on our own terms, regardless of the obstacles that may come our way.,1,\\\"\\\"\\\"a cowboy who rode the waves\\\"\\\"\\\",gemini_pro,true\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
